    "Since 1990 we encountered Jesus Christ in Turkey through the ministry of Pastor Corley. From 2000 to 2002 we received biblical teaching in the Immanuel Church in the Netherlands, where we were both baptized. Later, we joined the Iranian Church 222 in the Netherlands, where we received further spiritual formation and served in ministry. In 2022, led by the Holy Spirit, we founded the Light of the World Church in Almere. Our goal is to be a light in the darkness and bring the Gospel of salvation to Farsi speakers and others in this city, in the Netherlands, and to our beloved Iranian people worldwide.",
